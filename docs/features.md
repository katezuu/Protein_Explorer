# 🚀 Features

The Protein Structure Explorer includes several essential features:

### 🧬 Protein Visualization
Interactively explore protein 3D structures directly from the Protein Data Bank.

### 🔍 Structural Analysis
Analyze residues, chains, and the center of mass.

### ⚙️ Mutation Simulation
Model mutations and calculate metrics like RMSD and COM shifts.

### 📊 Ramachandran Plots
Visualize phi (φ) and psi (ψ) angles to evaluate protein structural validity.

### 📐 Structural Comparison
Easily compute and visualize the RMSD between two protein structures.

### 💻 Modern Web Interface
Built with Flask and Bootstrap, providing a clean, user-friendly experience.
